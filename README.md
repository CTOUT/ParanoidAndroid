# RimWorld Paradroid Mod

A RimWorld mod inspired by the classic 1980s game Paradroid, bringing robot hacking and control mechanics to the RimWorld universe.

## Overview

This mod introduces the strategic gameplay of Paradroid into RimWorld, allowing players to hack and control robotic entities through neural interface technology.

### Features

- **Neural Interface Implants**: Cybernetic implants that enable robot hacking
- **Robot Hacking System**: Take control of mechanoids and robotic enemies
- **Paradroid Data Cores**: Rare resources needed for advanced technology
- **Research Tree**: Progressive unlocking of robot control capabilities
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Use controlled robots tactically in combat and work

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Neural Interface
- Requires surgical installation
- Enables hacking attempts on robots and mechanoids
- Success depends on various factors (skill, robot type, etc.)

### Robot Control
- Temporarily or permanently take control of hacked robots
- Use controlled robots for combat, hauling, and other tasks
- Risk vs. reward system for different robot types

### Research Progression
1. **Paradroid Technology** - Basic neural interface and hacking
2. **Advanced Paradroid Systems** - Enhanced control and permanent takeover

## Installation

1. Subscribe to the mod on Steam Workshop (when available)
2. Or manually install by placing the mod folder in your RimWorld/Mods directory
3. Enable the mod in the game's mod menu
4. Start a new game or load an existing save
